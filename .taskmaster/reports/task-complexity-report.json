			"taskTitle": "Setup Chrome Extension Project with Manifest V3",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Chrome extension setup into subtasks such as: project directory creation, manifest.json configuration, permissions setup, content script declaration, web_accessible_resources configuration, background service worker setup, npm and dependency initialization, and webpack configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple setup steps but follows standard Chrome extension development practices. Each step is well-documented and can be handled independently, making the overall complexity moderate. The number of configuration files and required integrations (manifest, permissions, scripts, build tools) justifies a moderate subtask count.[1][4]"
